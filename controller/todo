## TODO
Move all discussions and opinions to discussion
	fast slow changing weights reasons
	discuss why the snake goes from failing early in each try to successfully do the path
	In the first tries the snake fails the first turn. Then the snake manages to do the first turn but fails at the second in the opposite direction. Then the snake again succedes in the other direction but dosent fail on the second turn since it can now do bot turns just fine. Thats why it is now able to complete the path without problems.
